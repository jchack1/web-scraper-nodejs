    "question": "What is CSS BEM?",
    "answer": "The BEM methodology is a naming convention for CSS classes in order to keep CSS more maintainable by defining namespaces to solve scoping issues. BEM stands for Block Element Modifier which is an explanation for its structure. A Block is a standalone component that is reusable across projects and acts as a \"namespace\" for sub components (Elements). Modifiers are used as flags when a Block or Element is in a certain state or is different in structure or style.\n/* block component */\n.block {\n}\n\n/* element */\n.block__element {\n}\n\n/* modifier */\n.block__element--modifier {\n}\n\nHere is an example with the class names on markup:\n<nav class=\"navbar\">\n  <a href=\"/\" class=\"navbar__link navbar__link--active\"></a>\n  <a href=\"/\" class=\"navbar__link\"></a>\n  <a href=\"/\" class=\"navbar__link\"></a>\n</nav>\n\nIn this case, navbar is the Block, navbar__link is an Element that makes no sense outside of the navbar component, and navbar__link--active is a Modifier that indicates a different state for the navbar__link Element.\nSince Modifiers are verbose, many opt to use is-* flags instead as modifiers.\n<a href=\"/\" class=\"navbar__link is-active\"></a>\n\nThese must be chained to the Element and never alone however, or there will be scope issues.\n.navbar__link.is-active {\n}\n\nGood to hearAlternative solutions to scope issues like CSS-in-JS\n"

    "question": "What is the purpose of cache busting and how can you achieve it?",
    "answer": "Browsers have a cache to temporarily store files on websites so they don't need to be re-downloaded again when switching between pages or reloading the same page. The server is set up to send headers that tell the browser to store the file for a given amount of time. This greatly increases website speed and preserves bandwidth.\nHowever, it can cause problems when the website has been changed by developers because the user's cache still references old files. This can either leave them with old functionality or break a website if the cached CSS and JavaScript files are referencing elements that no longer exist, have moved or have been renamed.\nCache busting is the process of forcing the browser to download the new files. This is done by naming the file something different to the old file.\nA common technique to force the browser to re-download the file is to append a query string to the end of the file.\n\nsrc=\"js/script.js\" => src=\"js/script.js?v=2\"\n\nThe browser considers it a different file but prevents the need to change the file name.\n"

    "question": "What are the advantages of using CSS preprocessors?",
    "answer": "CSS preprocessors add useful functionality that native CSS does not have, and generally make CSS neater and more maintainable by enabling DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles. Their terse syntax for nested selectors cuts down on repeated code. They provide variables for consistent theming (however, CSS variables have largely replaced this functionality) and additional tools like color functions (lighten, darken, transparentize, etc), mixins, and loops that make CSS more like a real programming language and gives the developer more power to generate complex CSS.\nGood to hearThey allow us to write more maintainable and scalable CSS\nSome disadvantages of using CSS preprocessors (setup, re-compilation time can be slow etc.)\n"

    "answer": "An element is a plain JavaScript object that represents a DOM node or component. Elements are pure and never mutated, and are cheap to create.\nA component is a function or class. Components can have state and take props as input and return an element tree as output (although they can represent generic containers or wrappers and don't necessarily have to emit DOM). Components can initiate side effects in lifecycle methods (e.g. AJAX requests, DOM mutations, interfacing with 3rd party libraries) and may be expensive to create.\nconst Component = () => \"Hello\"\nconst componentElement = <Component />\nconst domNodeElement = <div />\n\nGood to hearElements are immutable, plain objects that describe the DOM nodes or components you want to render.\nComponents can be either classes or functions, that take props as an input and return an element tree as the output.\n"

    "question": "Why does React use className instead of class like in HTML?",
    "answer": "React's philosophy in the beginning was to align with the browser DOM API rather than HTML, since that more closely represents how elements are created. Setting a class on an element meant using the className API:\nconst element = document.createElement(\"div\")\nelement.className = \"hello\"\n\nAdditionally, before ES5, reserved words could not be used in objects:\nconst element = {\n  attributes: {\n    class: \"hello\"\n  }\n}\n\nIn IE8, this will throw an error.\nIn modern environments, destructuring will throw an error if trying to assign to a variable:\nconst { class } = this.props // Error\nconst { className } = this.props // All good\nconst { class: className } = this.props // All good, but cumbersome!\n\nHowever, class can be used as a prop without problems, as seen in other libraries like Preact. React currently allows you to use class, but will throw a warning and convert it to className under the hood. There is currently an open thread (as of January 2019) discussing changing className to class to reduce confusion.\n"

    "question": "How do you clone an object in JavaScript?",
    "answer": "Using the object spread operator ..., the object's own enumerable properties can be copied\ninto the new object. This creates a shallow clone of the object.\nconst obj = { a: 1, b: 2 }\nconst shallowClone = { ...obj }\n\nWith this technique, prototypes are ignored. In addition, nested objects are not cloned, but rather their references get copied, so nested objects still refer to the same objects as the original. Deep-cloning is much more complex in order to effectively clone any type of object (Date, RegExp, Function, Set, etc) that may be nested within the object.\nOther alternatives include:\n\nJSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj)) can be used to deep-clone a simple object, but it is CPU-intensive and only accepts valid JSON (therefore it strips functions and does not allow circular references).\nObject.assign({}, obj) is another alternative.\nObject.keys(obj).reduce((acc, key) => (acc[key] = obj[key], acc), {}) is another more verbose alternative that shows the concept in greater depth.\n\nGood to hearJavaScript passes objects by reference, meaning that nested objects get their references copied, instead of their values.\nThe same method can be used to merge two objects.\n"

This is because they are being compared by their reference (location in memory), unlike primitive values which are compared by value.\nIn order to test if two objects are equal in structure, a helper function is required. It will\niterate through the own properties of each object to test if they have the same values, including nested objects.\nOptionally, the prototypes of the objects may also be tested for equivalence by passing true as the 3rd argument.\nNote: this technique does not attempt to test equivalence of data structures other than\nplain objects, arrays, functions, dates and primitive values.\nfunction isDeepEqual(obj1, obj2, testPrototypes = false) {\n  if (obj1 === obj2) {\n    return true\n  }\n\n  if (typeof obj1 === \"function\" && typeof obj2 === \"function\") {\n    return obj1.toString() === obj2.toString()\n  }\n\n  if (obj1 instanceof Date && obj2 instanceof Date) {\n    return obj1.getTime() === obj2.getTime()\n  }\n\n  if (\n    Object.prototype.toString.call(obj1) !==\n      Object.prototype.toString.call(obj2) ||\n    typeof obj1 !== \"object\"\n  ) {\n    return false\n  }\n\n  const prototypesAreEqual = testPrototypes\n    ? isDeepEqual(\n        Object.getPrototypeOf(obj1),\n        Object.getPrototypeOf(obj2),\n        true\n      )\n    : true\n\n  const obj1Props = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj1)\n  const obj2Props = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj2)\n\n  return (\n    obj1Props.length === obj2Props.length &&\n    prototypesAreEqual &&\n    obj1Props.every(prop => isDeepEqual(obj1[prop], obj2[prop]))\n  )\n}\n\nGood to hearPrimitives like strings and numbers are compared by their value\nObjects on the other hand are compared by their reference (location in memory)\n"

These nodes (such as elements and text nodes) are objects that can be programmatically manipulated and any visible changes made to them are reflected live in the document. In a browser, this API is available to JavaScript where DOM nodes can be manipulated to change their styles, contents, placement in the document, or interacted with through event listeners.\nGood to hearThe DOM was designed to be independent of any particular programming language, making the structural representation of the document available from a single, consistent API.\nThe DOM is constructed progressively in the browser as a page loads, which is why scripts are often placed at the bottom of a page, in the <head> with a defer attribute, or inside a DOMContentLoaded event listener. Scripts that manipulate DOM nodes should be run after the DOM has been constructed to avoid errors.\ndocument.getElementById() and document.querySelector() are common functions for selecting DOM nodes.\nSetting the innerHTML property to a new value runs the string through the HTML parser, offering an easy way to append dynamic HTML content to a node.\n"

Due to event bubbling, events \"bubble\" up the DOM tree by executing any handlers progressively on each ancestor element up to the root that may be listening to it.\nDOM events provide useful information about the element that initiated the event via Event.target. This allows the parent element to handle behavior as though the target element was listening to the event, rather than all children of the parent or the parent itself.\nThis provides two main benefits:\n\nIt increases performance and reduces memory consumption by only needing to register a single event listener to handle potentially thousands of elements.\nIf elements are dynamically added to the parent, there is no need to register new event listeners for them.\n\nInstead of:\ndocument.querySelectorAll(\"button\").forEach(button => {\n  button.addEventListener(\"click\", handleButtonClick)\n})\n\nEvent delegation involves using a condition to ensure the child target matches our desired element:\ndocument.addEventListener(\"click\", e => {\n  if (e.target.closest(\"button\")) {\n    handleButtonClick()\n  }\n})\n\nGood to hearThe difference between event bubbling and capturing\n"

    "question": "How does hoisting work in JavaScript?",
    "answer": "Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variable and function declarations are put into memory during the compile phase. This means that no matter where functions and variables are declared, they are moved to the top of their scope regardless of whether their scope is global or local.\nHowever, the value is not hoisted with the declaration.\nThe following snippet:\nconsole.log(hoist)\nvar hoist = \"value\"\n\nis equivalent to:\nvar hoist\nconsole.log(hoist)\nhoist = \"value\"\n\nTherefore logging hoist outputs undefined to the console, not \"value\".\nHoisting also allows you to invoke a function declaration before it appears to be declared in a program.\nmyFunction() // No error; logs \"hello\"\nfunction myFunction() {\n  console.log(\"hello\")\n}\n\nBut be wary of function expressions that are assigned to a variable:\nmyFunction() // Error: `myFunction` is not a function\nvar myFunction = function() {\n  console.log(\"hello\")\n}\n\nGood to hearHoisting is JavaScript’s default behavior of moving declarations to the top\nFunctions declarations are hoisted before variable declarations\n"

    "question": "Discuss the differences between an HTML specification and a browser’s implementation thereof.",
    "answer": "HTML specifications such as HTML5 define a set of rules that a document must adhere to in order to be “valid” according to that specification. In addition, a specification provides instructions on how a browser must interpret and render such a document.\nA browser is said to “support” a specification if it handles valid documents according to the rules of the specification. As of yet, no browser supports all aspects of the HTML5 specification (although all of the major browser support most of it), and as a result, it is necessary for the developer to confirm whether the aspect they are making use of will be supported by all of the browsers on which they hope to display their content. This is why cross-browser support continues to be a headache for developers, despite the improved specificiations.\nGood to hearHTML5 defines some rules to follow for an invalid HTML5 document (i.e., one that contains syntactical errors)\nHowever, invalid documents may contain anything, so it's impossible for the specification to handle all possibilities comprehensively.\nThus, many decisions about how to handle malformed documents are left up to the browser.\n"

Has rare use cases, like tracking component animations during the lifecycle. There are only few cases where this makes sense to use over other lifecycle methods. It expects to return an object that will be the the new state, or null to update nothing. This method does not have access to the component instance either.\ncomponentDidMount: Executed after first rendering and here all AJAX requests, DOM or state updates, and set up eventListeners should occur.\nshouldComponentUpdate: Determines if the component will be updated or not. By default, it returns true. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after state or props are updated, you can return a false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a rerender if component receives new prop.\ngetSnapshotBeforeUpdate: Invoked right after a component render happens because of an update, before componentDidUpdate. Any value returned from this method will be passed to componentDidUpdate.\ncomponentDidUpdate: Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes.\ncomponentWillUnmount: It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component.\ncomponentDidCatch: Used in error boundaries, which are components that implement this method. It allows the component to catch JavaScript errors anywhere in the child component tree (below this component), log errors, and display a UI with error information.\n"

    "answer": "CSS sprites combine multiple images into one image, limiting the number of HTTP requests a browser has to make, thus improving load times. Even under the new HTTP/2 protocol, this remains true.\nUnder HTTP/1.1, at most one request is allowed per TCP connection. With HTTP/1.1, modern browsers open multiple parallel connections (between 2 to 8) but it is limited. With HTTP/2, all requests between the browser and the server are multiplexed on a single TCP connection. This means the cost of opening and closing multiple connections is mitigated, resulting in a better usage of the TCP connection and limits the impact of latency between the client and server. It could then become possible to load tens of images in parallel on the same TCP connection.\nHowever, according to benchmark results, although HTTP/2 offers 50% improvement over HTTP/1.1, in most cases the sprite set is still faster to load than individual images.\nTo utilize a spritesheet in CSS, one would use certain properties, such as background-image, background-position and background-size to ultimately alter the background of an element.\nGood to hearbackground-image, background-position and background-size can be used to utilize a spritesheet.\n"

In non-strict mode, if the variable has not yet been declared, it will assign the variable as a property of the global object (window in browsers). In strict mode, it will throw an error to prevent unwanted global variables from being created.\nvar\nvar was the default statement to declare a variable until ES2015. It creates a function-scoped variable that can be reassigned and redeclared. However, due to its lack of block scoping, it can cause issues if the variable is being reused in a loop that contains an asynchronous callback because the variable will continue to exist outside of the block scope.\nBelow, by the time the the setTimeout callback executes, the loop has already finished and the i variable is 10, so all ten callbacks reference the same variable available in the function scope.\nfor (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n  setTimeout(() => {\n    // logs `10` ten times\n    console.log(i)\n  })\n}\n\n/* Solutions with `var` */\nfor (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n  // Passed as an argument will use the value as-is in\n  // that point in time\n  setTimeout(console.log, 0, i)\n}\n\nfor (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n  // Create a new function scope that will use the value\n  // as-is in that point in time\n  ;(i => {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      console.log(i)\n    })\n  })(i)\n}\n\nlet\nlet was introduced in ES2015 and is the new preferred way to declare variables that will be reassigned later.

The closure has access to variables in three scopes:\n\nVariables declared in its own scope\nVariables declared in the scope of the parent function\nVariables declared in the global scope\n\nIn JavaScript, all functions are closures because they have access to the outer scope, but most functions don't utilise the usefulness of closures: the persistence of state. Closures are also sometimes called stateful functions because of this.\nIn addition, closures are the only way to store private data that can't be accessed from the outside in JavaScript. They are the key to the UMD (Universal Module Definition) pattern, which is frequently used in libraries that only expose a public API but keep the implementation details private, preventing name collisions with other libraries or the user's own code.\nGood to hearClosures are useful because they let you associate data with a function that operates on that data.\nA closure can substitute an object with only a single method.\nClosures can be used to emulate private properties and methods.\n"

    "answer": "Event-driven programming is a paradigm that involves building applications that send and receive events. When the program emits events, the program responds by running any callback functions that are registered to that event and context, passing in associated data to the function. With this pattern, events can be emitted into the wild without throwing errors even if no functions are subscribed to it.\nA common example of this is the pattern of elements listening to DOM events such as click and mouseenter, where a callback function is run when the event occurs.\ndocument.addEventListener(\"click\", function(event) {\n  // This callback function is run when the user\n  // clicks on the document.\n})\n\nWithout the context of the DOM, the pattern may look like this:\nconst hub = createEventHub()\nhub.on(\"message\", function(data) {\n  console.log(`${data.username} said ${data.text}`)\n})\nhub.emit(\"message\", {\n  username: \"John\",\n  text: \"Hello?\"\n})\n\nWith this implementation, on is the way to subscribe to an event, while emit is the way to publish the event.\nGood to hearFollows a publish-subscribe pattern.\nResponds to events that occur by running any callback functions subscribed to the event.\nShow how to create a simple pub-sub implementation with JavaScript.\n"

    "question": "What is a focus ring? What is the correct solution to handle them?",
    "answer": "A focus ring is a visible outline given to focusable elements such as buttons and anchor tags. It varies depending on the vendor, but generally it appears as a blue outline around the element to indicate it is currently focused.\nIn the past, many people specified outline: 0; on the element to remove the focus ring. However, this causes accessibility issues for keyboard users because the focus state may not be clear. When not specified though, it causes an unappealing blue ring to appear around an element.\nIn recent times, frameworks like Bootstrap have opted to use a more appealing box-shadow outline to replace the default focus ring. However, this is still not ideal for mouse users.\nThe best solution is an upcoming pseudo-selector :focus-visible which can be polyfilled today with JavaScript. It will only show a focus ring if the user is using a keyboard and leave it hidden for mouse users. This keeps both aesthetics for mouse use and accessibility for keyboard use.\n"

When the tab is permanently closed, any data stored through sessionStorage is deleted.\n\nDifferences between localStorage and sessionStorage regarding storage scope:\nBoth forms of storage are scoped to the document origin so that documents with different origins will never share the stored objects.\n\nsessionStorage is also scoped on a per-window basis.

    "question": "Explain the differences between imperative and declarative programming.",
    "answer": "These two types of programming can roughly be summarized as:\n\nImperative: how to achieve something\nDeclarative: what should be achieved\n\nA common example of declarative programming is CSS. The developer specifies CSS properties that describe what something should look like rather than how to achieve it. The \"how\" is abstracted away by the browser.\nOn the other hand, imperative programming involves the steps required to achieve something. In JavaScript, the differences can be contrasted like so:\nImperative\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nconst numbersDoubled = []\nfor (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {\n  numbersDoubled[i] = numbers[i] * 2\n}\n\nWe manually loop over the numbers of the array and assign the new index as the number doubled.\nDeclarative\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nconst numbersDoubled = numbers.map(n => n * 2)\n\nWe declare that the new array is mapped to a new one where each value is doubled.\nGood to hearDeclarative programming often works with functions and expressions. Imperative programming frequently uses statements and relies on low-level features that cause mutations, while declarative programming has a strong focus on abstraction and purity.\nDeclarative programming is more terse and easier to process at a glance.\n"

    "question": "How do you ensure methods have the correct this context in React component classes?",
    "answer": "In JavaScript classes, the methods are not bound by default. This means that their this context can be changed (in the case of an event handler, to the element that is listening to the event) and will not refer to the component instance. To solve this, Function.prototype.bind() can be used to enforce the this context as the component instance.\nconstructor(props) {\n  super(props);\n  this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);\n}\n\nhandleClick() {\n  // Perform some logic\n}\n\n\nThe bind approach can be verbose and requires defining a constructor, so the new public class fields syntax is generally preferred:\n\nhandleClick = () => {\n  console.log('this is:', this);\n}\n\nrender() {\n  return (\n    <button onClick={this.handleClick}>\n      Click me\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n\nYou can also use an inline arrow function, because lexical this (referring to the component instance) is preserved:\n\n<button onClick={e => this.handleClick(e)}>Click me</button>\n\nNote that extra re-rendering can occur using this technique because a new function reference is created on render, which gets passed down to child components and breaks shouldComponentUpdate / PureComponent shallow equality checks to prevent unnecessary re-renders. In cases where performance is important, it is preferred to go with bind in the constructor, or the public class fields syntax approach, because the function reference remains constant.\nGood to hearYou can either bind methods to the component instance context in the constructor, use public class fields syntax, or use inline arrow functions.\n"

    "question": "What is recursion and when is it useful?",
    "answer": "Recursion is the repeated application of a process. In JavaScript, recursion involves functions that call themselves repeatedly until they reach a base condition. The base condition breaks out of the recursion loop because otherwise the function would call itself indefinitely. Recursion is very useful when working with data structures that contain nesting where the number of levels deep is unknown.\nFor example, you may have a thread of comments returned from a database that exist in a flat array but need to be nested for display in the UI. Each comment is either a top-level comment (no parent) or is a reply to a parent comment. Comments can be a reply of a reply of a reply... we have no knowledge beforehand the number of levels deep a comment may be. This is where recursion can help.\nconst nest = (items, id = null, link = \"parent_id\") =>\n  items\n    .filter(item => item[link] === id)\n    .map(item => ({ ...item, children: nest(items, item.id) }))\n\nconst comments = [\n  { id: 1, parent_id: null, text: \"First reply to post.\" },\n  { id: 2, parent_id: 1, text: \"First reply to comment #1.\" },\n  { id: 3, parent_id: 1, text: \"Second reply to comment #1.\" },\n  { id: 4, parent_id: 3, text: \"First reply to comment #3.\" },\n  { id: 5, parent_id: 4, text: \"First reply to comment #4.\" },\n  { id: 6, parent_id: null, text: \"Second reply to post.\" }\n]\n\nnest(comments)\n/*\n[\n  { id: 1, parent_id: null, text: \"First reply to post.\", children: [...] },\n  { id: 6, parent_id: null, text: \"Second reply to post.\", children: [] }\n]\n*/\n\nIn the above example, the base condition is met if filter() returns an empty array. The chained map() won't invoke the callback function which contains the recursive call, thereby breaking the loop.\nGood to hearRecursion is useful when working with data structures containing an unknown number of nested structures.\nRecursion must have a base condition to be met that breaks out of the loop or it will call itself indefinitely.\n"

Arrow functions implicitly bind this so that it refers to the context of its lexical environment, regardless of whether or not its context is set explicitly with call().\nHere are some common examples of how this works:\nObject literals\nthis refers to the object itself inside regular functions if the object precedes the invocation of the function.\nProperties set as this do not refer to the object.\nvar myObject = {\n  property: this,\n  regularFunction: function() {\n    return this\n  },\n  arrowFunction: () => {\n    return this\n  },\n  iife: (function() {\n    return this\n  })()\n}\nmyObject.regularFunction() // myObject\nmyObject[\"regularFunction\"]() // my Object\n\nmyObject.property // NOT myObject; lexical `this`\nmyObject.arrowFunction() // NOT myObject; lexical `this`\nmyObject.iife // NOT myObject; lexical `this`\nconst regularFunction = myObject.regularFunction\nregularFunction() // NOT myObject; lexical `this`\n\nEvent listeners\nthis refers to the element listening to the event.\ndocument.body.addEventListener(\"click\", function() {\n  console.log(this) // document.body\n})\n\nConstructors\nthis refers to the newly created object.\nclass Example {\n  constructor() {\n    console.log(this) // myExample\n  }\n}\nconst myExample = new Example()\n\nManual\nWith call() and apply(), this refers to the object passed as the first argument.\nvar myFunction = function() {\n  return this\n}\nmyFunction.call({ customThis: true }) // { customThis: true }\n\nUnwanted this\nBecause this can change depending on the scope, it can have unexpected values when using regular functions.\nvar obj = {\n  arr: [1, 2, 3],\n  doubleArr() {\n    return this.arr.map(function(value) {\n      // this is now this.arr\n      return this.double(value)\n    })\n  },\n  double() {\n    return value * 2\n  }\n}\nobj.doubleArr() // Uncaught TypeError: this.double is not a function\n\nGood to hearIn non-strict mode, global this is the global object (window in browsers), while in strict mode global this is undefined.\nFunction.prototype.call and Function.prototype.apply set the this context of an executing function as the first argument, with call accepting a variadic number of arguments thereafter, and apply accepting an array as the second argument which are fed to the function in a variadic manner.\nFunction.prototype.bind returns a new function that enforces the this context as the first argument which cannot be changed by other functions.\nIf a function requires its this context to be changed based on how it is called, you must use the function keyword. Use arrow functions when you want this to be the surrounding (lexical) context.\n"

    "question": "What is the purpose of JavaScript UI libraries/frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, Hyperapp, etc?",
    "answer": "The main purpose is to avoid manipulating the DOM directly and keep the state of an application\nin sync with the UI easily. Additionally, they provide the ability to create components that can be reused when they have similar functionality with minor differences, avoiding duplication which would require multiple changes whenever the structure of a component which is reused in multiple places needs to be updated.\nWhen working with DOM manipulation libraries like jQuery, the data of an application is generally kept in the DOM itself, often as class names or data attributes. Manipulating the DOM to update the UI involves many extra steps and can introduce subtle bugs over time. Keeping the state separate and letting a framework handle the UI updates when the state changes reduces cognitive load. Saying you want the UI to look a certain way when the state is a certain value is the declarative way of creating an application, instead of the imperative way of manually updating the UI to reflect the new state.\nGood to hearThe virtual DOM is a representation of the real DOM tree in the form of plain objects, which allows a library to write code as if the entire document is thrown away and rebuilt on each change, while the real DOM only updates what needs to be changed. Comparing the new virtual DOM against the previous one leads to high efficiency as changing real DOM nodes is costly compared to recalculating the virtual DOM.\nJSX is an extension to JavaScript that provides XML-like syntax to create virtual DOM objects which is transformed to function calls by a transpiler. It simplifies control flow (if statements/ternary expressions) compared to tagged template literals.\n"

    "question": "What does 'use strict' do and what are some of the key benefits to using it?",
    "answer": "Including 'use strict' at the beginning of your JavaScript source file enables strict mode, which enforces more strict parsing and error handling of JavaScript code. It is considered a good practice and offers a lot of benefits, such as:\n\nEasier debugging due to eliminating silent errors.\nDisallows variable redefinition.\nPrevents accidental global variables.\nOftentimes provides increased performance over identical code that is not running in strict mode.\nSimplifies eval() and arguments.\nHelps make JavaScript more secure.\n\nGood to hearEliminates this coercion, throwing an error when this references a value of null or undefined.\nThrows an error on invalid usage of delete.\nProhibits some syntax likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript\n"

    "question": "What is a virtual DOM and why is it used in libraries/frameworks?",
    "answer": "The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a representation of the real DOM in the form of plain JavaScript objects. These objects have properties to describe the real DOM nodes they represent: the node name, its attributes, and child nodes.\n<div class=\"counter\">\n  <h1>0</h1>\n  <button>-</button>\n  <button>+</button>\n</div>\n\nThe above markup's virtual DOM representation might look like this:\n{\n  nodeName: \"div\",\n  attributes: { class: \"counter\" },\n  children: [\n    {\n      nodeName: \"h1\",\n      attributes: {},\n      children: [0]\n    },\n    {\n      nodeName: \"button\",\n      attributes: {},\n      children: [\"-\"]\n    },\n    {\n      nodeName: \"button\",\n      attributes: {},\n      children: [\"+\"]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nThe library/framework uses the virtual DOM as a means to improve performance. When the state of an application changes, the real DOM needs to be updated to reflect it. However, changing real DOM nodes is costly compared to recalculating the virtual DOM. The previous virtual DOM can be compared to the new virtual DOM very quickly in comparison.\nOnce the changes between the old VDOM and new VDOM have been calculated by the diffing engine of the framework, the real DOM can be patched efficiently in the least time possible to match the new state of the application.\nGood to hearWhy accessing the DOM can be so costly.\n"
