# Web Scraper Node.js / Puppeteer

I came across this site while listening to a podcast and found it to be helpful in reviewing web dev knowledge: https://30secondsofinterviews.org/

I thought it would be helpful if I could add these questions to another flashcard app I created, so I used Puppeteer to scape the questions and answers.
